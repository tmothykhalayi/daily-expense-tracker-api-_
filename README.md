## **Daily Expense Tracker System Overview**

The **Daily Expense Tracker System** is a web-based application built using **NESTJS** and **PSQL** to help users manage their daily, monthly, and yearly expenses. The system enables users to record their daily expenses, track expenditures, generate reports, and view insights about their spending habits. The application consists of two primary modules: **User** and  **Admin** .

### **Database Schema Design**

Here is the database schema for the  **Daily Expense Tracker System (DETS)** :

#### **1. Users Table (`users`)**

| Column Name    | Data Type                         | Description                      |

### **Technologies and Tools**

1. **Frontend** :

* **HTML** ,  **CSS** , **JavaScript** (Basic frontend)
* **Bootstrap** for responsive design
* **Chart.js** or **Google Charts** for visualizing expense data

1. **Backend** :

* **NESTJS** for server-side processing
* **PSQL** for relational database management

1. **Authentication** :

* Use **PHP sessions** for user authentication and session management
* **Password hashing** using **bcrypt**

1. **Payment Integration** (Optional):
   * Integrate payment gateways (PayPal, Stripe) for premium user features or subscription plans.
2. **Email Integration** :

* Use **PHP mailer** or **SendGrid** for password recovery and user notifications.

---

### **Security Considerations**

1. **Password Security** : Use secure password hashing and salting techniques such as bcrypt.
2. **SQL Injection Prevention** : Use **prepared statements** and **parameterized queries** in SQL queries to avoid SQL injection vulnerabilities.
3. **Input Validation** : Sanitize and validate all user inputs to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) and other malicious attacks.
4. **Access Control** : Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure users and admins can only access their authorized features.
5. **Session Management** : Implement secure session management, including session timeout and token-based authentication if needed.
